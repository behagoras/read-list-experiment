This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Challenge

Create a small react app for the following:

- Mock and endpoint call that will return the following:

```json
[
  { "name": "Soda", "price": "10.00" },
  { "name": "Lemonade", "price": "15.00" },
  { "name": "Taco", "price": "8.00" },
  { "name": "Burrito", "price": "37.00" },
  { "name": "Toast", "price": "50.00" },
  { "name": "Ceviche", "price": "105.00" },
  { "name": "Cheese finger", "price": "33.00" },
  { "name": "Simple Water", "price": "10.00" },
  { "name": "Fish Taco", "price": "20.00" },
  { "name": "Desert", "price": "45.00" }
]
```

- Display the items in a list.

- Create a search field that will filter the given list.

- Search could be done by name or price, order DESC.

- Add tests.

- Should be user friendly.

- If possible, push it to a public repository so we can run it locally.

## How to run It

### Start the server

In the server directory, start the server:

It will run into your localhost in http://localhost:3001

#### 1. `cd server`

#### 2. `yarn start`

###Â Run the project

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
